# CheapShotYT-Print-2A-Master-Repo

The original repo went down, so I am in the process of recreating it, as well as adding any more information I can.

Please note that I am new at GitHub, so files may be added very slowely. I apologize for this.

The old repo went down due to lack of funds supporting it's activity on GitHub.
